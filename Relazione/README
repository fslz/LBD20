The frontespizio package lets you typeset a frontispiece (suitable for
Italian university style) independently of the page layout of the main
document.

This is version 1.4a of the package (a maintenance release
because the documentation was missing on TeX Live; no change
from version 1.4)

Changes from version 1.3a (unreleased):
o Added a new frontispiece shape for the "suftesi" class

Changes from version 1.3:
o Added an informative message in the "frn" file

Changes from version 1.2:
o Compatibility with memoir

Changes from version 1.1:
o A "Preambolo*" environment to collect things that had to be argument
  of several \Preambolo commands
o Option "nouppercase" to avoid uppercasing the second line
o The package honors the inputenc option in the main document also
  in the "frn" file
o Implementation modifications (use atbegshi instead of eso-pic and
  others)
o Documentation update

Changes from version 1.0:
o Added the option `swapnames', to exchange the position of
  candidate and advisor names
o Correction of a bug with option `onlyinclude'

This work has the LPPL maintenance status "author-maintained".

This work consists of the following files:

  README (this file)
  frontespizio.dtx
  frontespizio.ins
  frontespizio.pdf

and of the derived files

  frontespizio.sty
  examplea.tex
  exampleb.tex
  examplec.tex
  exampled.tex
  examplee.tex
  fakelogo.mp
  makedoc.sh

To install the distribution:

o run "latex frontespizio.ins"
o run "{|pdf|xe}latex example{a,b,c,d,e}.tex" for a test
o run "{|pdf|xe}latex example{a,b,c,d,e}-frn.tex" for a test
o run "{|pdf|xe}latex example{a,b,c,d,e}.tex" for a test
o after the tests, you should have correct dvi or pdf 
  example files (choose either latex, pdflatex or xelatex
  and compile each of the three examples)
o move "frontespizio.sty" to locations where LaTeX will find
  it (the FAQ on CTAN in /help/uktug-FAQ gives more
  information about this magic place)
